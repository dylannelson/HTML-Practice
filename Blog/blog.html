				<hr>
				<p>Hey there. This is my journey about me buying my bus and my attempt at turning
					into an RV kinda thing. My thoughts about this started when I when my dad was
					offered a chance to buy his neighbor's RV for 20k. To me that seemed crazy expensive
					but the thoughts of having a small home on the road to travel in, and being a shelter
					anywhere was really intriguing. I saw a few problems with motor homes though that made
					them really unnatractive
					<ul>
						<li>A lot of spaces is wasted on bulky kitchens. Who really needs an oven on the road?</li>
						<li>When buying used, needed repairs can go easily unnoticed and every time you check a new 
							RV it would cost at least $100 to have someone go through and check just the engines and 
							body of the vehicle.
						</li>
						<li>Sewage, gas lines, and wiring were my biggest fears of the above point. These three need to be
							maintainted as well, and they aren't really things I need in the first place
						</li>
						<li> RV's in general are expensive. Either you buy new and realize you could have bought a house with 
							that money or you buy used and risk spending thousands fixing and maintaining and storing it 
							(most storage places nearby cost at least $100 a month to store RV's)
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p> So basically what it came down to was: RV's are expensive, risky to buy, and very inneficient in their
					design/space. I don't need a kitchen, I don't need a big shower/bathroom, or even a seperate room for a
					bed. And each of these things just add to cost in many ways. So rather than get an RV with my dad, I was 
					able to buy a bus for myself

				<!----------------------     Day One ------------------------------------->
				<h2 id="D1">Day 1</h2>
				Aug 2nd 2020
				<hr>
				<p>Today was my first day after buying the bus. My friend Justin and I decided to
					start gutting the thing. I 
					really didn't own any tools before this so I went to Harbor Frieght and bought
					loads of cheap tools. This was reccomended to me by a few people as it's a good 
					way to get started and figure out what you <i> really </i> need before you invest
					in expensive tools. This really was a good idea because I totally ruined a few sets 
					of plyers because they got covered in tar from the underneath of the bus, and so far
					only quality tools I feel like I need are socket wrenches.
				</p>
				<p>
					Obviously the best place to start of was the seats. There are 6 rows of seats in
					the bus and they take up all the room. The left side was all 3 person seats and the 
					right was 2 person seats. So enough room for about 30. The seats were held to the walls
					with 3 heavy screws, bolded to a rail, and they were also held to the floor with 3 or 6
					bolts through the floor of the bus, depending on if it was a 2 or 3 seater. There were 2
					big problems with this.<br>
					The ones bolted to the floor went all the way through the floor, and had a nut on
					the bottom side of the bus, meaning someone had to go underneath and hold the nut while
					the other unscrewed from above. This lead to my two problems <br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Some nuts underneath were literally unreachable. Some were
					above the gas tank, or surrounded completely by other parts. <br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) The bottom of the bus had a layer of tar coating underneath
					to help prevent rusting. This made it 10x harder to unscrew the bolts as the threads were
					filled with tar <br>
					<!----------Tar Pic ---------->
					Today we only really had to deal with the tar, but we knew the unreachable nuts were soon 
					in our future. This was our first day and we were doing all this by hand. We had small
					and large socket wrench, and a pair of plyers, that was really it
