				<p>Hey there. This is my journey about me buying my bus and my attempt at turning
					into an RV kinda thing. My thoughts about this started when I when my dad was
					offered a chance to buy his neighbor's RV for 20k. To me that seemed crazy expensive
					but the thoughts of having a small home on the road to travel in, and being a shelter
					anywhere was really intriguing. I saw a few problems with motor homes though that made
					them really unnatractive
					<ul>
						<li>A lot of spaces is wasted on bulky kitchens. Who really needs an oven on the road?</li>
						<li>When buying used, needed repairs can go easily unnoticed and every time you check a new 
							RV it would cost at least $100 to have someone go through and check just the engines and 
							body of the vehicle.
						</li>
						<li>Sewage, gas lines, and wiring were my biggest fears of the above point. These three need to be
							maintainted as well, and they aren't really things I need in the first place
						</li>
						<li> RV's in general are expensive. Either you buy new and realize you could have bought a house with 
							that money or you buy used and risk spending thousands fixing and maintaining and storing it 
							(most storage places nearby cost at least $100 a month to store RV's)
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p> So basically what it came down to was: RV's are expensive, risky to buy, and very inneficient in their
					design/space. I don't need a kitchen, I don't need a big shower/bathroom, or even a seperate room for a
					bed. And each of these things just add to cost in many ways.
