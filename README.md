Just making a website for fun from scratch to learn html
Amount of commits will only be one a day (no matter the amount of content) because I'm using GitHub Desktop
Try to include progress updates with each push
This is my new years resolution for 2019, do a little every day to learn HTML (and eventually python for class)
Started on Jan 3rd (Out camping for New Years)
